For this project, I built a deep learning model to classify images using a dataset called CIFAR-10. 
The dataset has 60,000 small, 32x32 color images across 10 categories like airplanes, cars, and animals. 
My goal was to design a model that could correctly identify the category of an image.

I used a type of neural network called a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, which is great for working with images. 
To prepare the data for the model, I used Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas to clean, manipulate, and preprocess the data, 
ensuring it was in the right format for training. I also applied techniques like data augmentation—things like rotating and flipping 
the images—to help the model learn better. Additionally, I used methods like batch normalization and regularization to prevent 
overfitting, which is when a model performs well on training data but not on new data.

By the end, the model reached 93% accuracy on the test data, which I was really proud of. 
It showed me the importance of careful tuning and experimenting with different techniques to improve performane."

This project taught me a lot about building and optimizing machine learning models and working with 
tools like Python, NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow. I think these skills will help me contribute to this role, 
especially when it comes to building demos or working on AI projects with customers.
